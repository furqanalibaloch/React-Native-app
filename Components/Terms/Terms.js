          As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have the
          specific terms and conditions of Saylani Welfare Trust. Organizations
          may have their terms and conditions outlined on their official website
          or provided in specific documentation. To access the most accurate and
          up-to-date information regarding Saylani Welfare Trust's terms and
          conditions, I recommend visiting their official website or contacting
          them directly through official channels.
